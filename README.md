# Riparian Shading Study
 
The purpose of the riparian shading study is to identify the location and type of riparian (stream-side) vegetation needed to sustain water temperatures in a small cold-water stream that will support the health and reproduction of brown trout and other cold-water biota. The study is based in Brown's Creek located in Stillwater, Minnesota, USA. A particular challenge in this study is evaluating areas of the stream with predominantly grassy vegetation and prioritizing tree plantings where they will be most effective.

This Git-Hub project is under development to execute multiple tasks within the study using R, including:
* Comparison of shade estimated by (1) WinSCANOPY analysis of hemispherical photographs and (2) ArcGIS solar radiation analysis of LiDAR.
* Regression analysis of independent and dependent variables.
